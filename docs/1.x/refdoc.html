    Solution Overview
   </h2>
   <p>
    COHORTE is a platform for developing and rolling out robust and reliable software.
Software produced with COHORTE has a high level of robustness and reliability since its is made up of a range of components and services protected from one another by isolation containers. This modular architecture guarantees that software cannot be paralyzed in the event of failure of one of its components and that, for example, 100% of the data communicated is processed.
   </p>
   <p>
    This modular architecture ensures automatic service recovery after errors and to supply degraded responses in the event of unavailability of a component.
The platform incorporates a range of tried and tested basic components dramatically reducing specific developments, thereby reducing the cost of projects using them.
The level of reliability of software produced with COHORTE SDK also reduces operating and maintenance costs for the companies software packages.

     <p>
      COHORTE provides a framework to construct modularised applications consisting of software components that uses software services provided by other components. This approach allows to construct IT applications as mean of a set of components providing and requiring services. COHORET is compliant to OSGi specification.

      Multi-language programming
     </h3>
     <p>
      Components in a COHORTE system can be implemented in Java or Python programming languages using Apache Felix iPOJO (Java) and/or isandlatech iPOPO (Python) service-based component-model frameworks. There is also a partial support for .Net components using IronPython component facade (full support for .Net is in the project's roadmap) . You can also wrap other legacy modules implemented in other programming languages by using Python component wrappers. In addition, you can dynamically update the C code without any complications. COHORTE Provides a common implementation for Remotes Services allowing the integration of a mixture of components with zero configuration. Service provider can be implemented using Python and used by another component implemented in Java, and vise versa

   <p>
    A COHORTE system is a set of (distributed) Software Components connected together using services to ensure some functionality.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the following sub-section, we detail the main concepts behind COHORET system.
   </p>
   <h2 id="dynamic-components">
    Dynamic Components
   </h2>
   <p>
    COHORTE Components represents a software component providing a service and eventually requiring other services to do ensure some tasks. Components can be implemented using Python or Java programming languages. We support and provide component-based framework for each language. Cohorte components implements only business logic, all the distribution and dependencies with other components are managed by COHORTE. Components can be deployed and removed dynamically without stopping the system.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="http://cohorte.github.io/docs/1.x/key-concepts/key-convepts-img1.png"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    Java components are implemented using
    <a href="http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-ipojo.html">
     Apache Felix iPOJO
    </a>
    component-based model.
Whereas Python components are implemented using
    <a href="http://ipopo.coderxpress.net/">
     isandlaTech iPOPO
    </a>
    component-based model. This two component-based service-oriented models uses
    <a href="http://www.osgi.org">
     OSGi container
    </a>
    as runtime support. C#, C and other programming languages components could be wrapper in either Java or Python supported dynamic components.
   </p>
   <h2 id="isolates">
    Isolates
   </h2>
   <p>
    In COHORTE, OSGI containers could be created dynamically to host some set of related components. To communicate two remote components, COHORTE provides an implementation of
    <em>
     Remote Services
    </em>
    specification (part of OSGi specification) for Java and Python components. There is no need to provide specific configurations / proxies to get the
    <em>
     Remote Services
    </em>
    work, COHORTE provides
    <em>
     zero-config
    </em>
    approach for connecting remote services (Discovery and Transportation are automatic).
   </p>
   <p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="http://cohorte.github.io/docs/1.x/key-concepts/key-convepts-img2.png"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    COHORTE provides a mechanism to isolate faulty components in a seperate OSGi containers. This is way we refer and call OSGi containers
    <strong>
     Isolates
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <h2 id="nodes">
    Nodes
   </h2>
   <p>
    COHORTE Isolates are located and managed on
    <strong>
     COHORTE Nodes
    </strong>
    . Nodes can be created by users using a provided scripts. Each Node can manage (create / monitor / delete) several isolates. COHORTE internal components responsible for managing local isolates and their relation with other remote isolates are located on special purpose Isolate (created at Node’s startup and can not host applicative components).

   <h2 id="composers">
    Composers
   </h2>
   <p>
    The Composer is a special COHORTE Runtime Component responsible of instantiating the different components of an application respecting a composition specification. In COHORTE there are different Composer levels:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <em>
      Top Composer
     </em>
     : It loads the composition declarative description and computes the sets of components according to the node they must be instantiated on.
    </li>
    <li>
     <em>
      Node Composer
     </em>
     : It calculates the different isolates that must be exist for the local set of components.
    </li>
    <li>
     <em>
      Isolate Composer
     </em>
     : It uses framework-specific agents to request the instantiation of the components assigned to its isolate, and looks after their evolution.

    Overview
   </h2>
   <p>
    A COHORTE application is composed of a set of components requiring and providing services. These components can be located in one node or dispatched between a set of nodes.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a classical component-based frameworks, components are instantiated statically at a predefined locations. They are also configured to communicate together before starting the application. This leads to a situation in which a lot of configuration files should be managed (or even to recompile the components if the communication aspects are hard coded).
   </p>
   <p>
    In contrast, COHORTE Components are instantiated, configured and placed in the right node automatically. There is no need to implement the distribution related aspects like serialization or client/server interaction. Components are seen as black-boxes wired by
    <em>
     declared
    </em>
    (remote) services.
   </p>
   <p>
    To understand how COHORTE components could be implemented in different languages and could be distributed in different nodes, the following picture provides some insights about the underlying architecture of COHORTE and its main technologies.

   <p>
    To implement COHORTE
    <em>
     managed
    </em>
    components, COHORTE supports two main, already existing component-based frameworks :
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Apache Felix iPOJO (Java)
    </li>
    <li>
     Pelix/iPOPO (Python)
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    If you are already familiar with one of the two frameworks, all whats you have to do in order to get your components managed by COHORTE is to not instantiate them (using
    <code>
     @Instantiate
    </code>
    annotation or its XML equivalent). COHORTE will instantiate them automatically. To have benefits of Remote Services feature, your services should use primitive types instead of complex user-specific types. Next, you need to write a small description of your application components using the format explained hereafter.

  --update-config       Update startup configuration file with provided

    We can write the startup configurations in a separate JSON file (see How to use startup configuration files section). This options will simplify the command options list and allows sharing the same startup configurations between several nodes.

   <pre>  -n NODE_NAME, --node NODE_NAME

  --composition-file COMPOSITION_FILE
                        Composition file (by default 'composition.js'). All
                        composition files should be placed on 'conf' directory
  --auto-start AUTO_START
                        Auto-start the composition if this node is a Top

</pre>
   <p>
    We can provide a different node name than the already provided when the node is created (by using –node option). One important option of cohorte nodes is the
    <code>
     --top-composer
    </code>
    . If set, the node will be considered as a
    <strong>
     Top Composer
    </strong>
    (manages all the distribution of components among the available nodes). Users can also provide customised informations such as the http port to use for the
    <em>
     web-admin
    </em>
    component (see
    <a href="/docs/1.x/monitoring">
     monitoring chapter
    </a>
    ), or the port to use for the remote shell admin component.

   <p>
    The
    <code>
     --transport
    </code>
    option allow the use to choose which transport protocol to use between the actual node and the other nodes participating in the same application. You can provide a common seperated list of the supported protocols (
    <code>
     http
    </code>
    and
    <code>
     xmpp
    </code>
    for the moment). Each protocol need additional configuration options that should be provided seperataly using dedicated options (–xmpp-server for instance to mention the XMPP server to use).

    How to use startup configuration files

   <p>
    To avoid re-typing the same options each time a node is started, or to share the same configuration between several nodes, you can provide a
    <em>
     startup configuration file
    </em>
    which contains such startup configurations. The content of such file is described hereafter.

    The discovery is done using TCP multi-caste feature. This limits the scope of the discovered COHORET nodes to only available at a local network area LAN. To deploy you COHORTE nodes at the Internet level, you should use XMPP mode.
   </p>
   <h3 id="using-xmpp">
    Using XMPP
   </h3>
   <p>
    You need to start the Top Composer with the following configurations :
   </p>
   <div class="highlight">
    <pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">./run --app-id myapplication --transport xmpp <span class="se">\</span>
--xmpp-server server_url <span class="se">\</span>
--xmpp-port <span class="m">5222</span> <span class="se">\</span>
--xmpp-jid jid <span class="se">\</span>
--xmpp-pass password <span class="se">\</span></code></pre>
   </div>
   <p>
    For the other COHORTE nodes, you don’t need the
    <code>
     --xmpp-pass
    </code>
    . However, the XMPP server should accept
    <strong>
     anonymous
    </strong>
    connections.
   </p>
   <p>
    The
    <code>
     --xmpp-jid
    </code>
    is the same used by the Top Composer and the other nodes.
   </p>
   <h3 id="using-httpxmpp">

   <p>
    You can use the two transport protocols in the same time. At runtime, only one is used, if it does not work COHORTE choose the other one.
