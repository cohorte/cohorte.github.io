A new version of Cohorte (1.1.2) is released to correct the following small bugs found on the last release:

* Consider OSGi framework user-provided extra packages [isandlaTech/cohorte-runtime#36]
* Do not start Fragment bundles in OSGi [isandlaTech/cohorte-runtime#35]

We have also improved the cohorte-create-node command to generate a run command that considers COHORTE_BASE environment variable when running a Node.

See the full [CHANGELOG here](http://repo.isandlatech.com/maven/releases/org/cohorte/platforms/cohorte/1.1.2/cohorte-1.1.2-changelog.txt).

Best Regards,

The Cohorte Team.
